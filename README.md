# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Justin, a Computer Engineering student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines Manila. Welcome to my GitHub!

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm passionate about tech and always eager to learn new things. I currently have a basic grasp of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++â€”and I'm constantly leveling up my skills. Right now, I'm focusing on expanding my programming knowledge and working on fun projects to put what I learn into practice.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Working On
I'm exploring different areas of software development and looking for cool open-source projects to contribute to. No big personal projects just yet, but stay tuned!

## ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect
You can find my LinkedIn and reach me via Gmail through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Justinroyse). Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate, chat tech, or just say hi!

## ðŸŽ² Hobbies & Interests
- Solving 3x3 Rubik's Cubes (speedcubing is so satisfying!)
- Watching psychological horror movies (the deeper the plot, the better)
- Photography and video/photo editing
- Flairtending (think juggling, but with bottles)
- Animeâ€”especially those with deep, meaningful stories

Thanks for stopping by! âœ¨
